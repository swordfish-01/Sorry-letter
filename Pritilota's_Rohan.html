<p>Darling,</p>
<p>I am really sorry. <br>
I never wanted to hurt you. <br>
I know there was a misunderstanding between us, and I feel very bad about it.<br>
You are very special to me. <br>
 When you are upset, it makes me very sad.<br>I miss you a lot.<br>I wish I could go back and fix everything.</p>
<p>Please forgive me. I want to make things better.<br>
I care about you so much, and I donâ€™t want to lose you.</p>
<p>&ndash;Will you forgive me?(Pleaseeeeeeee).</p>
